# Summary of the Project
We are planning on developing a multi agent team-based hide and seek system. There will be two types of agents in our project. The first agent, **the hiders**, have the objective of trying to run away from the seekers and not get caught for as long as possible. The second agent, **the seekers**, have the objective of trying to find the hiders and trying to catch them within a time limit. Both the hiders and seekers will have to navigate obstacles and will have available to them various of tools and blocks to help them in their objectives.
